flutter_native_splash:
  # Steps to make this work:
  # 1. Customize the parameters below.
  # 2. run the following command in the terminal:
  # dart run flutter_native_splash:create
  # or if you place this not in pubspec.yaml and not in flutter_native_splash.yaml:
  # dart run flutter_native_splash:create -p ../your-filepath.yaml
  # 3. voila, done!

  # NOTES:
  # - in case you got some trouble, cleaning up flutter project might help:
  # flutter clean ; flutter pub get
  # - To restore Flutter's default white splash screen, run the following command in the terminal:
  # dart run flutter_native_splash:remove
  # or if you place this not in pubspec.yaml and not in flutter_native_splash.yaml:
  # dart run flutter_native_splash:remove -p ../your-filepath.yaml
